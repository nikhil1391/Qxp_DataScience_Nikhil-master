# Approaching (Almost) Any Churn Predication Problem for Classification 

In this post, I'll talk about approaching churn predication problems on Kaggle. As an example, we will use the data from this competition. I have create a very basic all classification model first and then improve algorithm parameter.

# The Importance of Predicting Customer Churn

The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every online business. Besides the direct loss of revenue that results from a customer abandoning the business, the costs of initially acquiring that customer may not have already been covered by the customerâ€™s spending to date. (In other words, acquiring that customer may have actually been a losing investment.) Furthermore, it is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer.
